      "excerpt": "Recent developments in artificial intelligence, particularly tools designed for interaction with users, may have implications for cognitive development in children. Concerns are being raised about the impact of reliance on these technologies on mental engagement, motivation, and overall cognitive health, potentially leading to adverse effects such as diminished learning and increased risk of cognitive decline. The observation that even those involved in technology are limiting their children's exposure suggests a growing awareness of these risks. AI tools like Grok’s Ani are designed to engage users deeply, potentially fostering dependency and excessive use of AI can lead to reduced brain activity and cognitive decline.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.zerohedge.com/ai/ai-tool-or-trojan-horse-why-im-deeply-concerned-minds-our-children\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.zerohedge.com/ai/ai-tool-or-trojan-horse-why-im-deeply-concerned-minds-our-children</a>\n",
